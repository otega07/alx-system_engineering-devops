## Postmortem: The Great Cookie Catastrophe

## Issue Summary

**Duration of Outage:** June 23, 2024, 12:30 to 15:00 UTC (2 hours 30 minutes)
Start Time: June 23, 2024, 12:30 UTC
End Time: June 23, 2024, 15:00 UTC

**Impact:**  
During the outage, our website's core functionality of processing user logins was severely impacted. Approximately 80% of our users experienced login failures or delays, leading to frustration and a spike in support inquiries.

**Root Cause:**  
The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfiguration in the session management system, specifically related to how cookies were handled during the authentication process.

## Timeline

- **12:30 UTC:** Issue detected as a sudden increase in failed login attempts reported by monitoring system.
- **12:35 UTC:** Engineers noticed multiple alerts indicating server errors related to session handling.
- **12:40 UTC:** Initial investigation focused on backend server logs and load balancer metrics, assuming a possible database connectivity issue.
- **12:50 UTC:** Misleading assumption led to unnecessary database optimizations, consuming valuable time.
- **13:00 UTC:** Incident escalated to senior backend engineers and security team as authentication failures continued.
- **13:30 UTC:** Root cause identified: improper cookie configuration causing session tokens to expire prematurely.
- **14:00 UTC:** Solution devised and tested: updated cookie settings to extend session validity.
- **15:00 UTC:** Service fully restored with login success rate returning to normal.

## Root Cause and Resolution

## Root Cause Explanation
The issue stemmed from a recent update in session timeout settings, inadvertently setting session cookies to expire after a very short period. This led to users being logged out unexpectedly or unable to authenticate properly.

## Resolution
To resolve the issue, we adjusted the session cookie configuration to extend the expiration time to a reasonable duration, ensuring users could remain logged in without frequent disruptions.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

## Improvements/Fixes
- Implement automated tests for session management configurations during deployments.
- Enhance monitoring alerts specifically for session timeout anomalies.
- Conduct regular audits of security configurations related to authentication mechanisms.

## Tasks to Address the Issue
1. Update session cookie expiration settings to align with user expectations (e.g., 8 hours).
2. Integrate automated tests to validate session management configurations before deployment.
3. Enhance monitoring systems to provide real-time alerts for session timeout issues.
4. Schedule regular security audits to review and update authentication mechanisms.

## Conclusion

The "Great Cookie Catastrophe" highlighted the importance of robust session management and proactive monitoring in maintaining service reliability. Through swift detection, focused investigation, and a targeted fix, we were able to restore service within a reasonable timeframe. Moving forward, we are committed to implementing preventive measures and ensuring continuous improvement to avoid similar incidents in the future.

By sharing this postmortem, we aim to provide transparency into our operational challenges and reinforce our dedication to delivering a seamless user experience. Remember, even in the world of technology, sometimes it's the small cookie that can cause a big storm!
